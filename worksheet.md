# Lab 1.0 - Worksheet

Many of your labs will have a worksheet containing questions that you 
will need to write answers to.  We have formatted them in markdown, 
but your answers will mostly be plain text.  You may need to submit
the `worksheet.md` file along with your source file(s) to the webhandin
and grader.

There are no questions to be answered for this first lab and you
do not need to hand this file in.
